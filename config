# Live Kit Name. Defaults to 'linux';
# This will be the name of the directory created on your CD/USB, which
# will contain everything including boot files and such.
# For example, Slax changes it to 'slax'
# Must not contain any spaces.
# If you change it, you must run ./tools/isolinux.bin.update script
# in order to update isolinux.bin for CD booting.
# If you do not need booting from CD (eg you're booting only from USB)
# then you can ignore recompiling isolinux.bin, just rename LIVEKITNAME
# and you're done.

# Kernel file, will be copied to your Live Kit
# Your kernel must support aufs and squashfs. Debian Jessie's kernel is ready

# If you require network support in initrd, for example to boot over
# PXE or to load data using 'from' boot parameter from a http server,
